# Welcome to PRO-CF

Welcome to the Physics and Rheology of Complex Fluids (PRO-CF) research group! :tada:

This github organization is our hub for a variety of different repositories, including:
- publically published AI/ML projects, DPD modules, and other useful scripts
- (private) onboarding and training scripts for new students and postdocs
- (private) legacy and back-up code from past projects
- (private) current code that is shared among teams and individual group members for different projects
- (private) code and drafts related to specific in-progress research papers or presentations

## Getting started

All members of the group can make repositories in this organization, in addition to using their own personal github. The PRO-CF "organization" are also grouped into our 3 teams:
- Colloids
- Machine Learning
- Hemorheology

See the Github Guide for tips on creating an account, getting access to the PRO-CF github organization, joining your team(s), and setting up command-line git.

## Adding repositories

Once you have access, you can make a new repository by going to the [PRO-CF main page](https://github.com/procf) and clicking the green "New" button.

We recommend selecting a template (such as the general-template) to make sure you get all the administrative files you need in your repository. Individuals and teams may also set up their own templates for you to choose from.<br>
More details about the general-template are [available here](https://github.com/procf/general-template) (internal only).

**Remember** Github limits the size of files you can upload, so you should only put code, documentation, and small (recommended <50MB and max 2GB) data files on github. All larger data, visualization, and analysis files should be stored on the /work directory on Discovery.
